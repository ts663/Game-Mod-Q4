Introducing Quakemon!

With your Quakemon by your side, you can fight other Quakemon in the wild and capture them to fill your Pokedex. Can you catch â€˜em all?

Use your Quakemon in battle to level them up and unlock new skills. They get stronger as they level up!

When you touch a wild Quakemon, a turn-based combat sequence will commence. You will get the first hit. Use the number keys to choose which action you want to perform (attack, heal, flee, etc.). If you defeat the wild Quakemon, you can capture it as your own.

You can also deploy your Quakemon outside of combat and watch it fight the other wild Quakemon, but you will not be able to capture it this way.
